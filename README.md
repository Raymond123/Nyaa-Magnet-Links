# Nyaa-Magnet-Links

Small webscraping script to get magnet download links for anime.

Uses text files to input the titles of each show to find links for. 
Then outputs the magnet links, for each ep of that show on the website nyaa.si, into a new text file.

Works in-tandem with the Anilist downloader app in order to read the magnet links and start the downloads.
